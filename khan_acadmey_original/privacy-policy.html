    1. What information do we collect?
</h2>
<p>
<b>We take the information you provide to us very seriously, and we strive to put you in control of decisions around your information.</b>
</p>
<p>
You can use many features of the Service without registering for an account or providing any other personal information. If you create an account on the Khan Academy Service, or communicate with Khan Academy, you may provide to Khan Academy what is generally called &ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo; or &ldquo;Personal Data,&rdquo; such as your full name, birthdate, email address or other information that can be used to identify you. Information which cannot be used to identify you as an individual is &ldquo;de-identified&rdquo; or non-personal information.
</p>
<p>
We collect information, including personal information, in a variety of ways which may vary according to your use of the Service and your account settings. The categories of personal information we collect may include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Contact and profile information</li>
    <li>Account and authentication information from third-party integrated services</li>
    <li>Location information</li>
    <li>Information about your browser or device</li>
    <li>Donation and applicant data</li>
    <li>Non-personal information which may be linked to your Personal Information</li>
</ul>
<p>
Below, we describe examples of the categories of information we collect from and about you when you use our Service:
</p>
<h4>
Information you provide to us and information we receive about you from others
</h4>
<div class="policy-indent">
<h5>
Contact and profile information.
</h5>
<p>
When you create an account on the Khan Academy Service, or communicate with us, we may collect personal information including your name, email address, and birthdate. After you register, you may also choose to provide additional information in your profile, such as your nickname, location (city), and other personal or demographic information. In addition, we may ask you for personal information at other times, such as when you contact our technical support team, send us an email, complete a user survey, or otherwise communicate with Khan Academy.
</p>
<h5>
Information from Integrated Sign-On Services.
</h5>
<p>
If you decide to register through or otherwise grant access to a third-party social networking or integrated service (what we call an &ldquo;Integrated Service&rdquo;), such as Facebook,  Google, Clever or similar single sign-on service, Khan Academy may also collect Personal Information that is already associated with your Integrated Service account. You may also have the option of sharing additional information with Khan Academy through an Integrated Service, as controlled through your settings on that Integrated Service. If you choose to provide such information, during registration or otherwise, Khan Academy will treat the information as Personal Information and will use it in the ways described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h5>
Information obtained from other users.
</h5>
<p>
We make available certain features on our Service that allow other users to provide us information about you. For example, a parent or teacher may provide information relating to a Child User, such as when a parent registers an account for their Child and provide us with certain information about the Child, such as user name and age.
</p>
<h5>
Information provided by partners and other sources.

<h2 id="how-we-share-or-transfer-data">
    3. How we share or transfer data
</h2>
<p>
Khan Academy takes great care to protect the information you provide us. We do not rent or sell Personal Information that we collect from users with third parties.
</p>
<p>
Khan Academy will disclose personal information when you post content which is visible to others on the Service, when you consent or instruct us to share your personal information with third parties, or when we have a legitimate business or legal need to share your information.  We may also disclose anonymous or aggregate information that does not reasonably identify you as an individual.  To learn more, see additional description below.
</p>
<h5>
When information is visible to others on the Service by default.
</h5>
<p>
Certain features and functions of the Service shares or makes your information accessible to others. As with most online services, once you make your Personal Information available to others online, it may be collected and used by the recipients or any other website visitor without restriction. You may wish to use a nickname or alias in your profile if you do not want your personal information shared with others in this way.  For example, your personal information may be visible to others in the following circumstances:
<div class="policy-indent">
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Information you post to public spaces of the Service.</b> When you post a question or answer to the Service, your profile, which could include your name, short biography, and city-level location, as well as the content of your posted comment, is visible to others on the Service.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Connecting with a Coach.</b> When your account is connected to a Coach on the Service, the Coach will be able to see your profile information and your activities on the Service, such as which videos you have watched, the questions and responses you post, and other usage information. Coaches may also be able to see your name (not only your username) as well as your email address, if you include that information in your account profile.
    </li>
</ul>
</div>
<h5>
With your consent or according to your instructions.
</h5>
<p>
You may provide consent or authorization to share your personal information with third party applications or services in several ways. Please note that these third parties are not governed by Khan Academy or the terms of this Privacy Policy. We recommend you review the privacy policy of any third party application or service before authorizing access to your Khan Academy account information.
</p>
<div class="policy-indent">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>We may share data with social networks at your request.</b> Some of our users choose to connect their Khan Academy account with social networks. This functionality is entirely optional. If you have explicitly agreed that we may do so, Khan Academy may disclose your Personal Information through a social network or similar service (like Facebook or Google). To control the information that you share, you have the option of modifying your Khan Academy or social network settings or disconnecting your social network account from your Khan Academy account.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>We may share data with third-party applications that you authorize.</b> Third-party application developers and service providers (commonly known as &ldquo;App Developers&rdquo;) may build complementary services for our platform, such as a mobile application for visually-impaired learners to access our resources, or may use our Khan Academy content to build unaffiliated applications and services. If you connect your Khan Academy account to an application or service, or approve access to your Khan Academy account by a third party application or service, you consent to Khan Academy sharing your information with that third party.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>We may share data in connection with special programs you participate in.</b> If you participate in special programs where Khan Academy partners with third parties, Khan Academy may share data collected from or about you with its third party partners to facilitate the program or services being offered. For instance, if you participate in Khan Academy&rsquo;s program with College Board, Khan Academy may share information regarding your study habits, tests taken, and test scores with College Board. These program partners may use your information we share with them as described in their own privacy policies.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>We may share information with your consent.</b> Khan Academy does not share your Personal Information with third-party organizations for their marketing or promotional use without your consent. In some instances, you may be able to grant us permission to share your Personal Information with authorized partners, not-for-profit organizations, and other entities that are not affiliated with Khan Academy. In these cases, we will only provide to these third parties the information you have authorized or asked us to share to these third parties. You may also choose to share content with others by email, or by posting Khan Academy content to social media sites such as Facebook or Twitter.  These third parties may use your information as described in their own privacy policies.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<h5>
We may share anonymous or aggregate data with others.
</h5>
<p>
We may use data which has been de-identified and/or aggregated for product development, research, analytics and other purposes, including for the purpose of analyzing, improving, or marketing the Khan Academy Services. In certain occasions, Khan Academy may share this data with business partners to improve our services or offerings.  If we disclose information to authorized business partners to conduct research on online education or assist in understanding the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services, promotions, and/or functionality on our Service, such data will be aggregated and/or anonymized to reasonably avoid identification of a specific individual.

        <li>
            <b>Other instances.</b> Khan Academy may release Personal Information if we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request; (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (d)  detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; (e) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Khan Academy, our users, or the public; or (f) as required or permitted by law.

</h2>
<h5>
Messages from Khan Academy
</h5>
<p>
We may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products and services, or other third party products and services we think you may enjoy.  For example, if we partner with a not-for-profit organization running a contest in your region we may send you an email notifying you of the partnership or contest.  We will not share your information with the third party unless you opt-in to participate in the partnership or contest, and if so, the information we would share would be limited to that needed to facilitate your participation in the contest and enable you to redeem your prize. You can unsubscribe from these mailings at any time. See Section 6 below.
</p>
<h5>
Sponsored Content
</h5>
<p>
Khan Academy does not display any third party advertisements on the Service. From time to time, we permit third parties to sponsor content displayed on our Service.  For example, for-profit organizations may wish to sponsor all content related to a particular educational topic, such as astronomy or biology. Sponsored content will always be labeled (e.g., &ldquo;Sponsored by ___&rdquo;).  Khan Academy does not share any of our users&rsquo; Personal Information with these sponsors without explicit consent, and these sponsors do not have the ability to track or collect information about our site visitors or users.  As a non-profit organization, Khan Academy relies on our sponsors, donors, and other contributors to provide funding necessary to provide the free Service to our users.
</p>
<p>
Please note: From time to time, we may display YouTube video content created by third parties and not by Khan Academy. While Khan Academy-created video content does not display video advertisements, third party content may include advertising which we cannot control.
</p>

<h2 id="third-parties-and-online-advertising">
    5. Third Parties and Online Advertising
</h2>
<h5>
Interest Based Advertising
</h5>
<p>
Khan Academy does not display any targeted advertising on our Service.  However, we participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements on other websites, apps or services, including on Facebook and other social networks, or on other devices you may use. These third party ad networks use tracking technologies to recognize your browser or device and to collect information about your visit to our Service to provide you customized content, advertising and commercial messages which may be more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market research.
</p>
<p>
Please note that we use our best efforts and take multiple steps to avoid the collection of information for targeted advertising purposes when we believe the Service is being used by students or children under 13. For example, we take steps to inhibit these third party advertising networks from collecting information for targeted advertising purposes on webpages with child-directed content or when a student or child user logs into the Service.
</p>
<p>
To learn about interest-based advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of some of this advertising, you may wish to visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s online resources, at <a href='http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices'>http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices</a>, and/or the DAA&rsquo;s resources at <a href='http://www.aboutads.info/choices'>http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a>. You may also manage certain advertising cookies by visiting the EU-based Your Online Choices at <a href='http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/'>http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/</a>. You may also be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings on your mobile device by selecting &ldquo;limit ad tracking&rdquo; (iOS) or &ldquo;opt-out of interest based ads&rdquo; (Android).  You may also be able to opt-out of some – but not all – interest-based ads served by mobile ad networks by visiting <a href='http://youradchoices.com/appchoices'>http://youradchoices.com/appchoices</a> and downloading the mobile AppChoices app.
</p>
<p>
Please note that opting-out of receiving interest-based advertising through the NAI&rsquo;s and DAA&rsquo;s online resources will only opt-out a user from receiving interest-based ads on that specific browser or device, but the user may still receive interest-based ads on his or her other devices. You must perform the opt-out on each browser or device you use.
</p>
<h5>
YouTube
</h5>
<p>
Khan Academy uses YouTube to display video content on the Service. YouTube incorporates tracking technologies, which may be present in the YouTube videos embedded on the Service, which may collect information from your browser when you view the video on the Service, including device identifiers and/or cookie IDs.  This information is collected directly and automatically by YouTube and its partners, and Khan Academy does not participate in these data transmissions. Khan Academy does not provide any Personal Information, such as user names, to YouTube.
</p>
<p>
Khan Academy has taken steps to minimize this tracking activity, to the extent we have controls over a third-party&rsquo;s practices.  We have turned on &ldquo;Privacy-Enhanced Mode&rdquo; for YouTube videos displayed on the Service.  We also utilize Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;child-directed treatment&rdquo; tags to alert Google that these YouTube videos may be embedded on webpages visited by children or students.  You can learn more about Google’s practices at <a href='http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners'>http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners</a>. You may also be able to control ad tracking through YouTube by visiting the Google Ad Settings page, currently available at: <a href='https://adssettings.google.com'>https://adssettings.google.com</a>.

    8. Our approach to Data Security
</h2>
<h5>
Data security is important to you, and to us.
</h5>
<p>
To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your information. For example, we may ask you to provide certain Personal Information to confirm your identity, and we may require that you create and use a password to access certain parts of our Service. You should create and maintain a strong password to help ensure the security of your account.
</p>
<h5>
We try to ensure that our Service and information sent to us are safe, but no security measures are perfect.
</h5>
<p>
Khan Academy uses certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards designed to preserve the integrity and security of your Personal Information and other information we maintain in connection with our Service. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any or all of the information you transmit to Khan Academy, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Khan Academy makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. When you enter sensitive information, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL) or similar technologies. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and will notify you of the security incident in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

Khan Academy is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing free, educational content. We strive to implement best practices to protect the privacy of all of our student and non-student users, alike.

Please note, because many of our user accounts are used for both School and non-School purposes, only personal information relating to user accounts which are (1) created by a School (for example, when a teacher creates the user name, login and password to establish School User accounts, or when the teacher rosters a class using Google Classroom, Clever, or similar single sign-on service), or (2) created by a School User at the direction of a School, using a School email address and associated with a School&rsquo;s class on the Service, and (3) created pursuant to a contract between Khan Academy and the School, are designated as Student Records on Khan Academy.  Student Records shall not include information a student or other individual may provide to Khan Academy independent of the student&rsquo;s use of the Service at the direction of the School.  For example, if a user connects her existing Khan Academy account (i.e., an account associated with a non-School email address and created outside of her use of the Service for the School&rsquo;s purposes) to a School’s class on the Service, the personal information and profile data associated with the account shall not be considered Student Records.  If you are a School, please contact us at <a href='mailto:schoolpartnerships@khanacademy.org'>schoolpartnerships@khanacademy.org</a> to learn more about how to create School User accounts which may hold Student Records.
</p>
<p>
<b>Our commitment:</b> We are proud supporters of the Student Privacy Pledge. Our collection and use of Student Records is governed by our contracts with the Schools, by our Privacy Policy, and by applicable privacy laws. For example, we work with Schools to help protect personal information from the Student’s educational record, as required by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (&ldquo;<b>FERPA</b>&rdquo;), and to protect the personal information of students under 13 consistent with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (&ldquo;<b>COPPA</b>&rdquo;).  If you have any questions about reviewing, modifying, or deleting the personal information of a School User accessing the Service through a School partner agreement, please contact your School directly.
</p>
<div class="policy-indent">
<ul>
    <li>
        We collect, maintain, use and share Student Records only for an authorized educational and as described in our Privacy Policy, or as directed by the School, the School User and/or the student&rsquo;s parent or legal guardian (a &ldquo;<b>Parent</b>&rdquo;).
    </li>
    <li>
        We do not disclose Student Records for targeted advertising purposes. While we do permit third party advertising partners to operate on our Service for the purpose of retargeting, analytics and attribution services, we disable third party ad networks when a School User logs into a School User account on the Service.
    </li>
    <li>
        We do not build a personal profile of a School User other than in furtherance of an educational purpose or as authorized by a Parent.
    </li>
    <li>
        We maintain a comprehensive data security program designed to protect the types of Student Records maintained by the Service.
    </li>
    <li>
        We will clearly and transparently disclose our data policies and practices to our users.
    </li>
    <li>
        We will never sell Student Records unless the sale is part of a corporate transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other sale of assets, in which case we will require the new owner to continue to honor the terms provided in this Privacy Policy or we will provide the School with notice and an opportunity to opt-out of the transfer of Student Records by deleting the Student Records before the transfer occurs.
    </li>
    <li>
        We will not make any material changes to our Privacy Policy or contractual agreements that relate to the collection or use of Student Records without first giving notice to the School and providing a choice before the Student Records are used in a materially different manner than was disclosed when the information was collected.
    </li>
</ul>
</div>
<h5>
How we share and disclose Student Records.
</h5>
<p>
We disclose Student Records in the manner described in our Privacy Policy under Section entitled How We Share and Disclose Information.  Depending on the features and account controls applicable to the School User accounts, we may share usernames and profile information with other users on the Service, such as teachers, coaches, or School administrators, and this information may be visible if a School User posts content in the discussion forums.
</p>
<p>
Depending on the manner in which Khan Academy is used by a School and the terms of the agreement between the School and Khan Academy, Khan Academy may provide access to certain Student Records, School User account usage data (&ldquo;<b>School Analytics</b>&rdquo;) and Teacher User account usage data to the School for the purpose of monitoring student usage and activity and evaluating the effectiveness of the School&rsquo;s use of the Khan Academy service. In some circumstances, School Analytics may only be available for Student accounts using a School email address or login and which are associated with a School’s teacher or coach.
</p>
<h5>
How we retain and delete Student Records.
</h5>
<p>
We will not knowingly retain Student Records beyond the time period required to support an educational purpose, unless authorized by a School, student or parent. Many of our users continue to use their accounts for a personal, non-School purpose and may associate their accounts with the account of their Parent. In such cases, the user (or the user&rsquo;s Parent) shall be responsible for account deletion requests.
</p>
<p>
All users, including School Users (or their Parents) can delete their accounts and all personal information associated with the account at any time through account Settings. See &ldquo;<a href='https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202263014-How-can-I-cancel-or-delete-my-account-'>How can I cancel or delete my account</a>&rdquo; in the Khan Academy Help Center for instructions.
</p>
<p>
The School is responsible for managing Student Records which the School no longer needs for an educational purpose by submitting a deletion request when such data is no longer needed. Schools should contact us at <a href='mailto:schoolpartnerships@khanacademy.org'>schoolpartnerships@khanacademy.org</a> to request deletion of Student Records associated with the School&rsquo;s use of Khan Academy. Please note that Khan Academy cannot comply with a School&rsquo;s request to delete personal information in a user account except for School User accounts created by a School (i.e., using a School email address and/or an account login provided by a School) pursuant to a contractual agreement between the School and Khan Academy, or unless the user (or the user&rsquo;s Parent) requests deletion directly.  We will also not be able to delete information associated with School User accounts that the School User has associated with a personal account.
</p>
<h5>

<h1 id="childrens-privacy-policy">
Khan Academy Children&rsquo;s Privacy Policy
</h1>

<h5>
Khan Academy is committed to children’s privacy.
</h5>
<p>
Protecting the privacy of children is especially important to Khan Academy. For that reason, we created certain features designed to help protect personal information relating to children who are less than 13 years of age (&ldquo;<b>Child Users</b>&rdquo;). Khan Academy does not knowingly permit Child Users to register directly for our Service without consent of a Parent or School.  If Khan Academy learns that Personal Information of a Child User has been collected on our Service without parental consent, then Khan Academy will take appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian (&ldquo;<b>Parent</b>&rdquo;) and discover that your child under the age of 13 has a registered account with our Service without your consent, please alert Khan Academy at <a href='mailto:privacy@khanacademy.org'>privacy@khanacademy.org</a> and request that we delete that child’s personal information from our systems.
</p>
<h5>
How children may register for and use our Service.
</h5>
<p>
Child Users can sign up for a Khan Academy account several ways.
</p>
<h5>
1. When a Child User signs up for a Khan Academy Account we request Parental consent.
</h5>
<p>
When a Child User registers for our Service, we request a birthdate, username, password, and a parent&rsquo;s email address so that we can email the Child User&rsquo;s Parent in order to seek consent for the Child to use the Service. Khan Academy does not ask the Child User for any more information than is necessary to provide the Service to the Child User or to seek parental consent.  The Child User is permitted to use the Service for seven (7) days through a Restricted Account (see below) while we notify the Parent for consent. If we do not receive Parental consent within 7 days, the Child User&rsquo;s Restricted Account is closed, and the Child&rsquo;s personal information is deleted from our systems.
</p>
<h5>
2. When a Child User account is created by a School, the School may provide consent.
</h5>
<p>
When the Khan Academy Service is used by a teacher, school, or district (a &ldquo;<b>School</b>&rdquo;) in the classroom for an educational purpose, we permit the School to create Child User accounts and to provide the requisite consent for Khan Academy to collect personal information of a Child User for this purpose, in lieu of parental consent.  Schools may create a Child User account by adding students to the Service through Google Classroom, Clever, or similar single sign-on service, or through a school integration mechanism, or a School may create logins/passwords for each individual student. When Schools create accounts in this manner, we do not request additional consent from the Parent.  However, when a School or other individual invites a Child User to join the Service and connect to a teacher or coach&rsquo;s class using a class code, we request parental consent in the manner described below.
</p>
<h5>
Methods for providing Parental consent.
</h5>
<p>
Parents may provide consent for a Child User to use the Service through a Restricted Account (explained below) by responding affirmatively to an email sent by Khan Academy to the Parent&rsquo;s email address provided by the Child User during registration. If we do not receive consent from the Parent within seven (7) days, the Child User&rsquo;s account will be closed and the Child&rsquo;s personal information is deleted from our systems.  Restricted Accounts may access and use certain features of the Service in a limited manner.
</p>
<p>
To enable additional functionality for the Child User account and to enable full access and control over the Child User&rsquo;s account activity, the Parent must create a Parent Account on the Service and connect to the Child User&rsquo;s account by clicking on the account creation link in the Parental consent notice.  Parent Accounts control the settings and functionality of the Child account. The Parent can maintain the Child&rsquo;s Restricted Account, and/or can enable additional functionality and data sharing features, if desired.  Parents can revoke a Child User&rsquo;s permissions to use the Service at any time by deleting the account.
</p>
<h5>
4. Restricted Accounts for Child Users.
</h5>
<p>
Khan Academy attempts to restrict a Child User&rsquo;s access to certain features that could result in disclosure of the Child&rsquo;s personal information.  A Restricted Account limits sharing and displaying private information about the Child User in various ways.
</p>
<p>
For example, a Child User with a Restricted Account cannot:
</p>
<div class="policy-indent">
<ul>
    <li>
        display personal information other than a username.  Restricted Accounts contain the Child&rsquo;s username and do not include other personal information or profile data. Because the username may be displayed on the Service, we strongly recommend selecting a username which does not relate to or identify the real name of the Child. The Child username can be selected or revised by the Parent by creating a Parent Account.
    </li>
    <li>
        add or edit personal information associated with a Restricted Account
    </li>
    <li>
        post to public discussion forums, or post questions or answers on lessons
    </li>
    <li>
        see or access links to third-party sites on the Service
    </li>
    <li>
        receive emails from Khan Academy (all emails are sent to the Parent email on file)
    </li>
    <li>
        communicate with or share personal information with Coaches other than a username and Service usage activity (i.e., lessons completed, badges earned, etc.). Similarly, Coaches cannot communicate with a Child User with a Restricted Account except to assign content for the Child User to view through the class.
    </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
A Parent who creates a Parent Account can manage and control additional features and functionality. For example, Parents can create or revise a Child&rsquo;s username; add or revise profile information; restrict or enable the Child User to add a Coach using a class code. Please see &ldquo;<a href='https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202262974-How-are-child-accounts-different-from-regular-accounts-'>How are child accounts different from regular accounts</a>&rdquo; in the Help Center to learn more.
</p>
<h5>
5. What information do we collect from a Child User?
</h5>
<p>
We collect a username, birthdate, and Parent&rsquo;s email address when a Child User registers for the Service, as well as any other personal information a Parent adds to a Child User&rsquo;s account, as described above. We collect information about the Child User&rsquo;s use of the Service (lessons completed, badges earned) as well as content the Child posts to the Service if such functionality is enabled by the Parent. We also collect usage and device information, as described in our Privacy Policy. We use this information to provide the Service to the Child User and for the purposes described in in our Privacy Policy&rsquo;s section &ldquo;<a href='#how-we-use-the-information-we-collect'>How we use the information we collect.</a>&rdquo; We use the Parent&rsquo;s email address to communicate messages about the account.
</p>
<h5>
6. How do we disclose information relating to a Child User?
</h5>
<p>
As described above, Restricted Accounts have limited data sharing capabilities. A username and progress information, along with any personal information the Parent added to the Child&rsquo;s profile, is shared with a Coach or teacher added to the Child User&rsquo;s account, though a Parent Account may restrict the Child User from adding Coaches  to the account. Parents may also enable additional data sharing features through a Parent Account, for example, by adding profile information and permitting the profile to be shared with Coaches and other users, or enabling the Child User to post content (e.g., questions and answers) to the Service. Parents that enable content-posting features should be aware that a Child User could post personally identifiable information in free-form content on the Service, and should monitor the Child User&rsquo;s posts and delete personal information if needed.  We may also disclose personal information of Child Users for business purposes, as described in the Privacy Policy section &ldquo;<a href='#other-instances-where-we-may-share-or-disclose-information-for-legal-or-business-purposes'>Other instances where we may share or disclose information for legal or business purposes.</a>&rdquo;
</p>
<h5>
7. Third party tracking and online advertising.
</h5>
<p>
Khan Academy does not display any targeted advertising on the Service. We do not disclose personal information of Child Users for direct marketing purposes or for targeted advertising purposes.  While we do permit third party advertising partners to operate on our Service for the purpose of retargeting, analytics and attribution services (See our Privacy Policy section &ldquo;<a href='#third-parties-and-online-advertising'>Third Parties and Online Advertising</a>&rdquo;), we take steps to disable third party ad networks on webpages with child-directed content or when a Child User logs into a Restricted Account on the Service.
</p>
<h5>
YouTube
</h5>
<p>
Khan Academy uses YouTube to display video content on the Service. YouTube incorporates tracking technologies, which may be present in the YouTube videos embedded on the Service, which may collect information from your browser when you view the video on the Service, including device identifiers and/or cookie IDs. This information is collected directly and automatically by YouTube and its partners, and Khan Academy does not participate in these data transmissions. Khan Academy does not provide any personal information, such as usernames, to YouTube.
</p>
<p>
Khan Academy has taken steps to minimize this tracking activity, to the extent we have controls over a third-party&rsquo;s practices. We have turned on &ldquo;Privacy-Enhanced Mode&rdquo; for YouTube videos displayed on the Service. We also utilize Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;child-directed treatment&rdquo; tags to alert Google that these YouTube videos may be embedded on webpages visited by children under the age of 13. You can learn more about Google&rsquo;s practices at <a href='http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners'>http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners</a>. You may also be able to control ad tracking through YouTube by visiting the Google Ad Settings page, currently available at: <a href='https://adssettings.google.com'>https://adssettings.google.com</a>.
</p>
<h5>
8. How to access, modify and delete your Child&rsquo;s personal information.
</h5>
<p>
As a Parent, you have the ability to access control information about your Child User in the &ldquo;Your Children&rdquo; section of your Parent Account. To refuse future collection or use of your child&rsquo;s Personal Information, you can delete your Child User&rsquo;s Account by following the instructions in our <a href='https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202263014'>FAQ</a>. Please note, you must delete your Child User’s account <u><i>before</i></u> you delete the Parent Account.
</p>
<p>
If you do not have a Parent Account associated with your Child User&rsquo;s Restricted Account, you may contact us at <a href='http://khan.co/KA-support'>http://khan.co/KA-support</a> to access or delete the Child User&rsquo;s account. Please note you will need the Child User&rsquo;s username, and we may take steps to authenticate your identity before we can provide access to the Restricted Account.
