Why does MIT OpenCourseWare need my donation?

Your gift to MIT OpenCourseWare demonstrates your commitment to knowledge as a public good and is an important part of OCW's overall sustainability plan, which includes support from MIT, endowment income, corporation and foundation support, and other revenue. Your donation is also important in demonstrating to sponsors and funders how much our visitors value the site.
How much does it cost to operate OCW?

The total annual cost of MIT OpenCourseWare is about $2.7 million. The effort required to produce OCW may not be readily apparent, but for each course we publish we must compile course materials from faculty, ensure proper licensing for open sharing, and format materials for global distribution. Additional rich media, such as our very popular video content, is especially costly. We must also sustain a considerable technical infrastructure to manage content and distribute it through a worldwide network to our global audience. In addition, we provide and support local mirror sites in bandwidth constrained regions.

How is MIT OpenCourseWare run?

Courses published on our site require an average of 100 hours of effort to produce. While the MIT faculty devote 5-10 hours of their own time for each course, it would be impossible for them to produce OCW courses alone. In order to publish materials from 200 courses each year while minimizing impact on MIT faculty time, OCW maintains a publication staff of twelve people who work directly with the faculty to collect and compile course materials, ensure proper licensing for open sharing, and format materials for our site. We also employ two intellectual property staff and four production staff who support our publication team. In addition, OCW has five outreach and administrative staff who manage communications, media relations, outreach, program evaluation, and OCW's sustainability.
